OSI Model:

The OSI model (Open Systems Interconnection) is a conceptual framework used to understand network communication. It divides communication into seven layers:

1. Physical: Transmission of raw data over physical media (electric, light, or radio signals)
2. Data Link: Responsible for node-to-node data transfer and error detection (MAC addresses)
3. Network: Responsible for logical addressing and routing (IP, ICMP)
4. Transport: Responsible for reliable or fast data delivery (TCP, UDP)
5. Session: Manages sessions between applications
6. Presentation: Handles data format translation, encryption, and compression
7. Application: Provides network services to end-users (HTTP, SMTP, SNMP)
